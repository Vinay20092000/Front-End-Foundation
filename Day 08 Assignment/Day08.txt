__ Backlinks, also known as inbound or incoming links, are hyperlinks from one page or website to another. So, for instance, if another website connects to     yours, you earn a backlink, and when you connect to another site, you are providing them with a backlink.
   These can be a great source of valuable referral traffic. Being featured on other relevant sites introduces your brand to new audiences who could then go    on to become loyal customers. Backlinks also enable search engines to find your new content more easily for speedier indexing.
