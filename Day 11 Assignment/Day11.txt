Q2 What is CDN? What are the advantages of using CDN URL?
__ It stands for Content delivery network,A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of servers spread out over a region or around the world that work    together to speed up content delivery on the web. The servers in a CDN temporarily store (or cache) webpage content like images, HTML, JavaScript, and    video. They send the cached content to users who load the webpage. Today, almost all websites and applications rely on a CDN to help serve content to    their users.
 
   Advantages:
   Performance
   Faster performance is the benefit most people think of when considering CDNs, and for good reason. Websites that start using a CDN have seen 50%    reductions in load times, or even more in some cases.

   Reliability
   Sometimes, things go wrong on the Internet. Servers go down, networks become congested, and connections get interrupted. A CDN enables web applications    to provide uninterrupted service to users even in the face of these problems.

   Cost savings
   The main way that CDNs cut down on expenditure for website operators is by reducing trips to and from the origin server. Because CDNs cache much of the    content on a website and serve that content from the cache, the origin server does not have to deliver the same content over and over. Instead, the CDN    does this on the origin server's behalf.

   Resilience against attack
   CDNs are especially well-suited to defending websites from denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In these attacks, an    attacker directs vast quantities of junk network traffic at a website to try to overwhelm and crash the website. With their many servers, CDNs are better    able to absorb large amounts of traffic, even unnatural traffic spikes from a DDoS attack, than a single origin server.
